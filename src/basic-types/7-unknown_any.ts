// The any type is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript, allowing you to gradually opt-in and opt-out of type checking during compilation.

// Unlike unknown, variables of type any allow you to access arbitrary properties, even ones that donâ€™t exist. These properties include functions and TypeScript will not check their existence or type:
let looselyTyped: any = 4;
// OK, ifItExists might exist at runtime
looselyTyped.ifItExists();
// OK, toFixed exists (but the compiler doesn't check)
looselyTyped.toFixed();

let strictlyTyped: unknown = 4;
// strictlyTyped.toFixed(); //NOT WORK;
