// A handy feature of enums is that you can also go from a numeric value to the name of that value in the enum. For example, if we had the value 2 but werenâ€™t sure what that mapped to in the Color enum above, we could look up the corresponding name

enum Direction {
  Up = 'UP',
  Down = 'DOWN',
  Left = 'LEFT',
  Right = 'RIGHT',
}

console.log(Direction.Down);
